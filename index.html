            <p>The snowdrop's dainty white flowers are a symbol of hope.</p>
            <h2>
              The delicate white blooms of snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) bring
              joy to the winter months. They are a sure sign that warmer weather
              is on the way and a symbol of hope. Find out when you can expect
              to see these special flowers, the best places to look for them and
              how your snowdrop sightings could help a long-running science
              project.

            <p class="plain-text">
              <span><u>Snowdrops</u></span> generally flower from January to
              March, but the exact timing depends on the weather and where you
              live in the UK. In warmer winters, they have been seen in December
              and even as early as mid-November, so it’s not too soon to start
              looking, especially if you live in the south of the UK.

              Snowdrops grow in many places across the UK. Look for them in
              parks, gardens, woodland and meadows, and alongside roads and
              riverbanks.

            <h1 class="topic">The value of snowdrop sightings</h1>
            <br />
            <p class="plain-text">
              Our citizen science project, Nature’s Calendar, is all about
              phenology - the study of seasonal changes in plants and animals
              from year to year. Anyone can volunteer, anywhere in the UK to
              help us record seasonal changes in their area, including when
              snowdrops first flower. The data recorded helps us to better
              understand the effects of climate change and other patterns in the
              natural environment. <br /><br />
              Our volunteers find a local patch of snowdrops and, at least once
              a week throughout winter and spring, watch as they grow. When the
              petals have opened just enough to see inside the flower, they
              record the snowdrop’s ‘first flowering’ date on Nature’s Calendar.
              The sightings are displayed on a live map, so why not have a look
              to see if snowdrops have been seen flowering where you live?
            </p>

            <h1 class="topic">What do snowdrop flowering records tell us?</h1>
            <br />
            <p class="plain-text">
              Logging these first flowers only takes a few minutes but the data
              is really valuable - scientists use it to monitor the effects of
              weather and climate change on UK wildlife. Analysis of Nature’s
              Calendar snowdrop records has shown a relationship between
              temperature and when snowdrops start flowering. For every 1°C
              warmer the average January temperature is, the date of snowdrops
              first flowering advances by 3 days. And a comparison of Nature’s
              Calendar snowdrop data with that of the Royal Meteorological
              Society from 1937-1947 shows that snowdrop flowering is now
              earlier than in the mid-20th century.
